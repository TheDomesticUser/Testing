
Magic Number: Write a program that requires the user to guess a generated number between 1 and 10.
You will display the appropriate messages prompting the user.
You will also need to keep track of and display the following information (ideally after the guess or during quit):

Total Guesses
The magic number
Win(s)
Quit (or give up)
